    <h1 class="page-title">Equipment</h1>
    <span class="span">Outdoor equipment is taken to mean all the indispensable, important and useful items required for
      hill walking, walking and camping outside. Depending on the use, outdoor gear is split into specific areas such as
      walking gear, trekking gear, camping gear and mountaineering gear.

      When camping, comfort is often the biggest consideration for your gear, while low weight and small pack size are
      important when you're walking, mountaineering or climbing. Many useful objects have versatile uses for camping as
      well as hillwalking and Alpine use.</span>
